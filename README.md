# what is this for?
Vermillion is a group chat that you can effortlessly customise. Just host it on your platform of choice and send a link to your friends!

# installation
First, either `git clone` or download the repository.

Then `npm init` the folder and `npm start` it. You can then connect to the app at http://localhost:3001.

# where should i host vermillion?
I would recommend Heroku because it is free and fairly quick, but it should work on many other platforms. If you just want to try it out with your friends try localtunnel: https://localtunnel.github.io.
