# vermillion
Instant messanger. Uses Vanilla JS, Socket.io, Node.js and Express.

# what is this for?
Vermillion is designed to be an easily modified group chat. Just use your platform of choice to host it and invite your friends!

# installation
First, either `git clone` or download the repository.

Then `npm init` the folder and `npm start` it. You can then connect to the app at `localhost:3001`

# where should i host vermillion?
I would recommend Heroku because it is free and fairly quick, but it should work on many other platforms.
